# Polynomial-regression
Few scripts using different programming languages and approaches to tackle fitting problems.

## Summary
As personal project I wanted to study one mathematical problem along with differents programming languages.
I begun with Python see /Python repo for scripts and mathematics.
Then I switched to Cpp. Copy-pasted few graphic engine functions from [kavan010 git](https://github.com/kavan010).
For reminders and proof of algebra theorems used, please see [this website](https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/1553/index2.html)

** I might push some script using Rust ** 


## Python
First few scripts were done in Python.
At first I decided to go from scratch and have zero look online and just give it a try with what I had in mind.
